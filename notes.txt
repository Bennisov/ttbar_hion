10X: Basic analysis code was drafted. First version of MC ntuple was analyzed. PT of leptons for every channel was analyzed. Event selection:
dielectron - 2 e with opposite charges and pt > 15GeV
electron-muon - one of each with opposite charges and pt > 15GeV
dimuon - 2 mu with opposite charges and pt > 15GeV
mu-jet - 1 muon with pt > 15GeV
el-jet - 1 e with pt > 15GeV


23X: New version of MC: version 2 with METs. We implemented further selection of events. We demanded that leptons should pass LOOSE OP. We compared variables like lepton eta, jet multiplicity. Comparison of MET value and phi for different METs (calculating algorythms) and channels. We checked number of events passing new OP cut. Issue with inefficiency of OP was noticed.


4XI: We analyzed MET in context of centrality of impact.


7XI: Improvement in numbers of events (efficiency of e reco) was noticed as new MC ntuple was introduced. It contanis new HI OPs that provide better statistics. Counts in electron and muon coresponding channels now are similiar. We analyzed MET differences for combined channels. All selected MET anlgorytms provide similliar histograms for MET value and MET phi: no differences were found. We found no issues for all METs.
